## Background

---

Lacy St. Art Lounge is a popular LA tattoo parlor with talented artists and various styles. The space is stylish and artistic, with strict hygiene standards. It’s a great place to get a quality and original tattoo in the Los Angeles Area.

## Solution

---

The solution of this project is to developed web application for the Lacy St. Art Lounge tattoo parlor. This website showcases the portfolios of the artists working at the tattoo parlor, allowing potential customers to browse through their previous works and get a sense of their artistic styles. This website also provides detailed information about the services offered, including tattoo styles, and pricing. One of the important features of the website will be the ability to submit an inquiry that will enable clients to easily submit inquiries with the required information. Additionally, this website facilitates client-artist communications, allowing clients to directly communicate with their chosen artists to discuss their tattoo ideas and ask questions. By providing a user-friendly and informative website, the Lacy St Art Lounge aims to enhance customer convenience and satisfaction, increase business visibility in the digital realm, and improve the overall efficiency in managing inquiries and appointments. This website will serve as a powerful tool to attract new clients, showcase the artistic talent of the tattoo artists, and elevate the professional image of the tattoo parlor.

## Prototype

</p>

<br>
During our prototype phase, we developed a figma demo which showcased our ideas for the website. In the demo (viewable above) we created a few of the base pages that would be used for the final product. 

The following pages were created:
   Contact page for getting in contact with the artist
   Main portal to select the artist
   Admin login to modify the websites’ contents
   Service page to show off the the available tattoo areas
   About page for the artist
   Portfolio page to show of the artist’s artwork
   And the inquire page that was deprecated to the contact page later in development

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
